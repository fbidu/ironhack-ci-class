# Basic CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Lesson Overview :pencil2:

In this lesson, we will explore the fundamentals of Continuous Integration and
Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and how to implement a basic pipeline using
GitHub Actions.
Weâ€™ll discuss the history and evolution of Software Engineering as a field,
highlighting the challenges of older approaches and the benefits of CI/CD

## Learning Objectives :notebook:

[ðŸš¨ to be removed, only for SME eyesðŸš¨ - start]
*Learning Objectives clearly define the specific skills or knowledge that participants should acquire by the end of the lesson. These objectives serve as measurable outcomes and guide the development of lesson content. All learning objectives should start with some verb (action). Check the pdf "Blooms Taxonomy Handout" to learn more about this.*

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

1. Learning Objective 1 [ðŸš¨ Provide a concise statement of the first objective. ðŸš¨]
2. Learning Objective 2: [ðŸš¨ Describe the second objective, ensuring clarity and specificity.ðŸš¨]
3. Learning Objective 3: [ðŸš¨ Continue with subsequent objectives, maintaining a logical progression.ðŸš¨]
4. Learning Objective 4: [ðŸš¨ Add more objectives if necessary, but keep the total number reasonable.ðŸš¨]
5. Learning Objective 5: [ðŸš¨ Finalize the list of objectives, ensuring they align with the overall goals of the lesson.ðŸš¨]
