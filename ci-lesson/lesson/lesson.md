# Basic CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Lesson Overview :pencil2:

In this lesson, we will explore the fundamentals of Continuous Integration and
Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and how to implement a basic pipeline using
GitHub Actions.
Weâ€™ll discuss the history and evolution of Software Engineering as a field,
highlighting the challenges of older approaches and the benefits of CI/CD
