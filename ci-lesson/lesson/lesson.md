# Basic CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Lesson Overview :pencil2:

In this lesson, we will explore the fundamentals of Continuous Integration and
Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) and how to implement a basic pipeline using
GitHub Actions.
Weâ€™ll discuss the history and evolution of Software Engineering as a field,
highlighting the challenges of older approaches and the benefits of CI/CD

1. Define CI/CD and explain its importance in modern software development.
1. Identify the core components and features of GitHub Actions.
1. Create a basic GitHub Actions workflow to automate the testing or build process.
1. Configure triggers, jobs, and steps in a GitHub Actions pipeline.

### History of CI: Why Itâ€™s Needed in Modern Software Development

#### The Old Ways: Traditional Development  
- **Description:**  
  In traditional software development workflows, teams often worked in silos.
  Developers built features in isolation over weeks or months without integrating
  their code. Integration happened only at the end of the development cycle.

  While softwares can be tightly specified and designed, those specifications
  will eventually leave some room for ambiguity and interpretation, sometimes
  without even the developers noticing. If two different developers are working
  on parts of the project that will eventually interact with each other, they
  they may accidentally make assumptions about the other's work that are not
  true.

- **Challenges of Traditional Approaches:**  
  1. **Integration Hell:** When teams finally attempted to merge their work,
    they often encountered massive conflicts, which required extensive effort to resolve.  
  2. **Delayed Feedback:** Bugs werenâ€™t discovered until much later in the process,
    increasing the cost and effort to fix them.  
  3. **Unpredictable Releases:** Since integration and testing were done manually,
    release timelines were often missed due to unforeseen issues.  

In short - developing code in isolation without regular integration and testing
makes the feedback loop quite big. This in itself trickles down into the overall
time budget of the project. Furthermore, this approach creates additional
problems of its own.

#### Enter Continuous Integration  
- **Definition:**  
  Continuous Integration introduced the practice of merging all developers'
  changes into a shared repository multiple times a day,
  followed by automated testing to identify issues early.  

- **Advantages:**  
  1. **Early Bug Detection:** Developers receive early feedback on their changes.  
  2. **Improved Collaboration:** Regular integration encourages teamwork and prevents siloed work.  
  3. **Reliable Builds:** Frequent automated builds ensure a deployable product is always available.

  In short, when contrasted with the older model, a structure based on CI/CD
  practices allows for a more predictable and reliable development process.
