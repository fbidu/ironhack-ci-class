# Check For Understanding (Activity)

- Activities/exercises given as a follow up of a lesson
- Should be timed - students should spend up to 15 min on each activity and there should be a review in the next 10ish minutes
- **"WE DO" / Activities** - After a brief exposition to some key concept, students will rapidly go hands-on and try it out. Activities are embedded through classes to diagnose student understanding of a new topic. The top goal is to assess if the class is ready to move forward and learn a new concept.
    
**Types of CFUs:** 
    
- **See and do** - students will replicate what they have just seen in the class
- **Challenge accepted** - students will know how to do 60-80% of the exercise if they followed the class examples, and they will be instructed to go in the "wild" (Google) to find the answers to finish this exercise
- **Research/discussion** - students will be asked to do research on some topics or answer some questions and then they will present to the class their findings

**CFU organization:**
