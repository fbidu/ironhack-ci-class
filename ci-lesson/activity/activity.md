This activity will help you practice and assess the knowledge and skills you just learned. During a bootcamp, it's important to spend a lot of time practicing what you've learned. The exercises given to you are just the start. You will get the opportunity to practice more in labs and later, in projects.

We encourage you that once you finish the exercises on the Student Portal platform, try to find more challenges to work on online

**Note:** You are provided with solution to each exercise. The purpose of providing solutions to exercises is to allow you to compare your own work to see if you have a similar or correct approach.

It is not meant to be used as a way to cheat or copy the answers.
